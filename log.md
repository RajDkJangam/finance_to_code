# Week 1: Feb. 20 - Feb 26

## Goals

* Complete first three books in the [YDKJS series on Github](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/README.md), and commit associated practice exercises. 

## Recap 

As with most technical reading, I didn't get truly absorb most of the material that I read this week in the [YDKJS book](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), but was exposed to several huge concepts when dealing with the Javascript language.  I took notes off and on, but my true intention for the week was to do a quick brush through of the book so that I am familiar with the concepts when I come back to the material later.  My curriculum is set to bring me back to the second half of the YDKJS book, and before reading this second half, I will review the first half with a greater working knowledge of computer science thanks to the CS50 course online.  

Many of the ideas in the book made sense thanks to some of the coding that I have already done, while others went right over my head.  It was frustrating at times, but I kept pushing through knowing that I will eventually be coming back to the concepts again and implementing them in real coding problems. 

# Week 2: Feb 27 - Mar 5

## Goals 

* Read [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
* Complete [Portfolio Site Front-End Project from Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

This week, my focus is on becoming more practical with my learning.  Last week was informative, but I didn't actually implement most of the things that I "learned."  

## Recap 

* Wednesday - I realized that before I get any further, I ought to learn how to sync local directories with a GitHub repo.  On Wednesday, I ready through the first 3/4 of [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_16.html), and watched the last section of Udacity's ["How to Use Git and Github"](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) course.  I then pulled my finance_to_code repository to my local machine, and setup a remote GIT URL as an alias to the local repository.  I will now be tracking commits and practicing "best commit practices".

This week was frustrating.  Not only was I bogged down by a golf tournament and other schoolwork, but somehow I deleted all of my project files!  I completed my portfolio site Sunday night, had it looking good, and then when I tried to open it up after closing, it was completely gone.  I believe that I mistakenly overwrote the files when I attempted to pull changes from my submodule.  Usually I am careful with my saving practices when working on projects, but as a new user of git, I have to pay extra attention to what I am doing!  I did not realize how easy it was to overwrite files.  When I did the "git pull" command, I was in the submodule directory rather than the submodule copy on the main repo, which caused the version control to overwrite my work with the old files in the master repository.

The only thing I am a bit confused about is why I cannot see this action in the git log?

For now, I am going to stay away from working with submodules, and hone my basic git skills.  Each project will now live in a separate repository with its own version control.  

Unfortunately, I do not have time to redo the portfolio site, as I need to move on to the next modules in the curriculum I have created.  Despite the mishap, I learned a ton about HTML and CSS in regards to layouts and content positioning.

# Week 3: Mar 6 - 12

## Goals 

* Complete CS50 Problem set 2 
* Complete CS50 Problem set 3


## Recap 

I successfully completed both problem sets this week, but they took much longer than expected.  Pset 2 required me to write a program to encrypt a string according to both a single letter "cipher code" and a cipher code made up of a string, where each letter in the string represented a different cipher value.

Relevant files: [caesar.c](https://github.com/zachgoll/finance_to_code/blob/master/cs50/pset2/caesar.c), [initials.c](https://github.com/zachgoll/finance_to_code/blob/master/cs50/pset2/initials.c), [vigenere.c](https://github.com/zachgoll/finance_to_code/blob/master/cs50/pset2/vigenere.c)

Pset3 was a bit trickier, and required a good deal of math.  The problem set aimed to teach the process of sorting arrays (both 1-d and 2-d structures), and searching through those arrays with various methods such as binary search, linear search, selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and insertion sort.

I did not write code for all of the sorting methods, but instead wrote my game of fifteen and find programs with selection sort.

Relevant files: [helpers.c](https://github.com/zachgoll/finance_to_code/blob/master/cs50/pset3/helpers.c), [fifteen.c](https://github.com/zachgoll/finance_to_code/blob/master/cs50/pset3/fifteen.c)

Overall, I felt that this week was a wake-up call and was my first week of this project struggling through lines of code.  Until this week, I have dealt with either reading materials or simple HTML and CSS.  This week, I found myself digging to the deepest parts of my brain sorting through all the logic within the C programs.  It seemed like these short programs took way too long, but from what I have read, that is the nature of programming, so I am not too worried about it.

# Week 4: Mar 13 - Mar 19
