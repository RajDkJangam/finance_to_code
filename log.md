# Week 1: Feb. 20 - Feb 26

## Goals

* Complete first three books in the [YDKJS series on Github](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/README.md), and commit associated practice exercises. 

## Recap 

As with most technical reading, I didn't get truly absorb most of the material that I read this week in the [YDKJS book](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), but was exposed to several huge concepts when dealing with the Javascript language.  I took notes off and on, but my true intention for the week was to do a quick brush through of the book so that I am familiar with the concepts when I come back to the material later.  My curriculum is set to bring me back to the second half of the YDKJS book, and before reading this second half, I will review the first half with a greater working knowledge of computer science thanks to the CS50 course online.  

Many of the ideas in the book made sense thanks to some of the coding that I have already done, while others went right over my head.  It was frustrating at times, but I kept pushing through knowing that I will eventually be coming back to the concepts again and implementing them in real coding problems. 

# Week 2: Feb 27 - Mar 5

## Goals 

* Read [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
* Complete [Portfolio Site Front-End Project from Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

This week, my focus is on becoming more practical with my learning.  Last week was informative, but I didn't actually implement most of the things that I "learned."  

## Recap 

* Wednesday - I realized that before I get any further, I ought to learn how to sync local directories with a GitHub repo.  On Wednesday, I ready through the first 3/4 of [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_16.html), and watched the last section of Udacity's ["How to Use Git and Github"](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) course.  I then pulled my finance_to_code repository to my local machine, and setup a remote GIT URL as an alias to the local repository.  I will now be tracking commits and practicing "best commit practices".
