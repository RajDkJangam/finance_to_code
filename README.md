    # Finance to Code

As a weary student soon to graduate with a degree in Corporate Finance, I decided it was about time to get serious about my career in web-development and computer science.  For years, I've been tinkering with the idea, but it wasn't until now that reality slapped me in the face and made this proejct more of a necessity than a pipe dream.  

The project I'm embarking on certainly won't be easy nor will it be perfectly engineered, but it should take me from where I am now to an employable/versatile front-end developer.  My ultimate goal is to become employable/employed *before* I complete the curriculum I have set in front of myself. 

# Goals 

* Before the project is over, make some sort of income freelancing with my new skills 
* By the end of the project, land a job as a full-time junior front-end developer

# Project Background

I initially got the idea after stumbling upon [a post made in the FCC forums](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-get-job-ready-with-1-fcc-cert-3-projects-2-courses-and-10-books/64027) by [P1xt](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/P1xt), and decided it looked both practical enough and difficult enough to get me where I want to go.  After a bit of exploration, I found another post from the same user that provided a much more detailed path to becoming a front-end developer.  These posts, along with the [100 days of Code](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) challenge were the inspiration behind this project.  

Although the roadmap looked great right out of the box, I have slightly altered it based on my personal educational history and current aptitudes, and organized it on a master Trello board with help from another FCC (free code camp) community member ([Markj78](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/markj78)).  My curriculum is a combination of the two posts made by [P1xt](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/P1xt), and is aimed to replicate the real world of junior development as closely as possible.  You can find [the board here](https://trello.com/b/jUujIqxP) (I will also be adding updates, projects, and miscellaneous code to this repository). 

# Guidelines  

* All work uploaded to Github in this repository.  I will learn how to use [Git in the terminal](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html) and refer to [this cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).
* Weekly and monthly reviews of my progress will live here in the [master log](https://github.com/zachgoll/finance_to_code/blob/master/log.md).
* For each module that does not consist of a project, I will commit some sort of code to github displaying the various things that I learned in that particular module.
* All code will be written in [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), and development environment run locally. 

## Individual Project Guidelines

* A new submodule will be created for each minor project (brand new repository for larger projects), and all projects will be deployed via [surge.sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZA8QVLOinE), or Heroku (if full-stack).
* All projects will respect copyright and trademark laws.  Proper attribution will be given to all sources. 
* For help on projects, I will use official documentation, MDN, Stack Overflow (but no copy/pasting), and Github.  The goal is to avoid deviating from the listed resources, and learning to read through all the technical jargon rather than wasting days on some new Udemy/Lynda course that could easily have been learned in a few hours if I had done the hard reading.
* Throughout the project, I will develop some sort of basic build process and use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for my task runner software.
* For each project, I will run at least 2 automated tests (Mocha and Jasmine)
* A README.md file will be included in each project repository
* I will follow the ["7 Rules of a Great Commit Message"](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for each new substantial commit (not for updating the log.md or things like that).
  * Subject line: If applied, this commit will *your subject line here*
* All CSS files will have [BEM naming conventions](http://getbem.com/naming/), following [this guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/bem-methodology-for-small-projects/).

# Acceptable distractions from the main path 

As with all endeavors I embark on, distractions will be my biggest enemy.  The main thing to watch out for is signing up for all sorts of online courses (ex: building a portfolio website, and buying a Udemy course on Adobe Illustrator for designing the website).  In light of this, I have designated the following to be my "acceptable distractions:" 

* [Coding Game](https://www.codingame.com/start)
* Solving problems on Free Code Camp
* [Working on an open source project](https://www.codetriage.com/)
