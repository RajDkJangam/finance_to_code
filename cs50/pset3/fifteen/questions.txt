0. The game of fifteen supports a board size from anywhere from 3x3 (dimmin) to 9x9 (dimmax), where the dimensions will 
always produce a dxd square
1. The game board is represented by a 2-d array data structure
2. greet();
3. I am tasked with creating functions init(), draw(), move(), and won().

Game testing: 

./fifteen 3 < ~cs50/pset3/3x3.txt

./fifteen 4 < ~cs50/pset3/4x4.txt

Note about 2-d array: 

[x][y] format where x is the row, and y is the column
