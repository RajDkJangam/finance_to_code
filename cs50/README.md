Prior to starting CS50, I had basic knowledge of programming concepts thanks to Colt Steele's Web Dev Udemy course (project
files here).  Throughout CS50, I learned: 

* Fundamentals of Computer Science (basic data structures and algorithms)
* Basic C programming concepts
* Python web development with Flask and Jinja
* Using Javascript with Google Maps API
* Central processing units, machine language, virtual machine language, assemblers, and compilers (thanks to my final project)

### Final Project

Since I took the course off-campus, my final project took much longer than the recommended 1-2 weeks.  Nevertheless, the
concepts I learned enhanced my understanding of the C programming language and computers in general.  See the link below:
